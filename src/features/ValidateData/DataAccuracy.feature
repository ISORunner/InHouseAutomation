Feature: Data Accuracy
  As a data quality analyst
  I want to verify the accuracy of data
  So that it correctly represents real-world entities and events

  Scenario: Cross-check data against authoritative sources
    Given a dataset with customer information
    When I compare it with the official customer database
    Then all records should match the authoritative source

  Scenario: Validate numerical values fall within acceptable ranges
    Given a dataset with transaction amounts
    When I check each transaction amount
    Then all amounts should be between $0 and $10,000

  Scenario: Confirm data adheres to specified formats
    Given a dataset with date fields
    When I check each date field
    Then all dates should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD
