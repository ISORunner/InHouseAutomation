Feature: Data Integrity
  As a data quality analyst
  I want to ensure data integrity during operations
  So that data remains accurate and consistent

  Scenario: Ensure data remains consistent before and after transactions
    Given a dataset before a transaction
    When I perform the transaction
    Then the dataset should remain consistent

  Scenario: Confirm changes to data are properly logged
    Given a dataset with an audit trail
    When I make changes to the data
    Then all changes should be recorded in the audit trail

  Scenario: Check data adheres to integrity constraints
    Given a dataset with foreign key constraints
    When I validate the constraints
    Then all should be satisfied
