Feature: Data Uniqueness
  As a data quality analyst
  I want to ensure each record is unique
  So that there are no unintended duplicates

  Scenario: Verify primary keys are unique across the dataset
    Given a dataset with primary keys
    When I check for uniqueness
    Then all primary keys should be unique

  Scenario: Detect and resolve duplicate entries
    Given a dataset with multiple records
    When I search for duplicate entries
    Then no duplicate records should exist

  Scenario: Validate composite keys are unique
    Given a dataset with composite keys
    When I check for uniqueness
    Then all composite keys should be unique
