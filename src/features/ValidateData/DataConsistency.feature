Feature: Data Consistency
  As a data quality analyst
  I want to ensure data consistency across systems
  So that data remains uniform and reliable

  Scenario: Verify data consistency across multiple databases
    Given a customer record in Database A
    When I compare it with Database B
    Then the customer information should be identical

  Scenario: Identify and address duplicate records
    Given a dataset with multiple records
    When I search for duplicate entries
    Then no duplicate records should exist

  Scenario: Ensure referential integrity between related tables
    Given an orders table with foreign keys to customers
    When I check the foreign key references
    Then all should correctly reference existing customer records
