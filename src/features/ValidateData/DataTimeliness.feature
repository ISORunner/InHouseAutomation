Feature: Data Timeliness
  As a data quality analyst
  I want to ensure data is up-to-date
  So that it is available when needed

  Scenario: Check data is updated within expected timeframes
    Given a dataset updated daily
    When I check the last update timestamp
    Then it should be within the last 24 hours

  Scenario: Assess data latency from source to destination
    Given a data pipeline from source to warehouse
    When I measure the data transfer time
    Then it should not exceed 2 hours

  Scenario: Verify scheduled data refresh processes occur as planned
    Given a data refresh schedule
    When I check the refresh logs
    Then all processes should have run at their scheduled times
