Feature: Data Completeness
  As a data quality analyst
  I want to ensure all required data fields are populated
  So that the dataset is complete and reliable

  Scenario: Verify mandatory fields are populated
    Given a dataset with multiple records
    When I check each record
    Then all mandatory fields should be populated

  Scenario: Ensure optional fields are correctly populated
    Given a dataset with multiple records
    When I check each record
    Then optional fields should be populated when applicable

  Scenario: Confirm record count matches expectations
    Given an expected record count of 1000
    When I count the records in the dataset
    Then the actual record count should be 1000
