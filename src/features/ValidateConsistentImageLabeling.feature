Feature: Validate Consistent Image Labeling
  As an AI/ML team
  We want to ensure that the tool accurately label images
  So we can have accurate results based on known examples.

  Scenario: Validate consistent labeling for a set of known images
    Given a pre-trained image classification model is loaded
    When I input a set of known images
    Then the predicted labels should match the expected labels with at least 50% accuracy

  @wip
  Scenario: Validate labeling consistency under different lighting conditions
    Given a pre-trained image classification model is loaded
    And a set of labeled images is available
    When I input images with different lighting variations
    Then the predicted labels should match the expected labels with at least 85% accuracy

  @wip
  Scenario: Validate consistent labeling for different angles of images
    Given a pre-trained image classification model is loaded
    And I have a set of images taken from different angles
    When I input these images to the model
    Then the predicted labels should match the expected labels consistently across all angles

  @wip
  Scenario: Validate labeling consistency in noisy images
    Given a pre-trained image classification model is loaded
    And I have a set of images with added noise
    When I input the noisy images to the model
    Then the model should label these images accurately with at least 85% accuracy
